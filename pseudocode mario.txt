start asking the user with an prompt (using printf on the screen)to input height of hashes (#) in order to create mario's pyramid
the height required to this code needs to be between 1 and 8 (using integers with function get_int)
in order to create the pyramid, it is required to use for loops and do while conditions to print hashes and print new lines
the hashes will have heights and lines (1x1 minimum and 8x8 maximum, in each row)
if the height isn't between those numbers
the output should be invalid
else, the output should be the number of hashes (#) that will create the pyramid
end of code
