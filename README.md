Code for "Mario" Problem Set 1 - Harvard's CS50

This code was tested and executed beforehand. 
The goal of this program was to ask to the user to put a prompt ("Insert the height") within the numbers 1-8 in order to receive an output, creating in text, using hashes (#) as bricks to emulate the pyramid of Super Mario Brothers, a Nintendo videogame.
Using a formula of rows + columns, the code requires the functions of loops and for to execute in the right way. First of all, it was made a pseudocode so the ideas were more precise and clear.
Feel free to use the commit tool to make suggestions on this code! Hope you enjoy.
